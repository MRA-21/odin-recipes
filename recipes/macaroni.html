        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>¾ cup dry bread crumbs</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
            <li>8 ounces macaroni</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>1 small onion, minced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon dry mustard</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups milk</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 2-quart casserole dish.</li>
            <li>Place bread crumbs into a small bowl and mix well with melted butter; set aside.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add macaroni and cook until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes; drain, then place into the prepared casserole dish.</li>
            <li>While pasta is cooking, melt 2 tablespoons butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in minced onion and cook until onion softens and turns translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in flour, salt, pepper, and dry mustard until incorporated, then pour in milk and bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring constantly, until milk has thickened, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and stir in Cheddar cheese until melted. Pour cheese sauce over macaroni, then sprinkle evenly with buttered bread crumbs.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until top is golden and bubbly, about 20 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
